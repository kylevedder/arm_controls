// Stuck detection thresholds for ready movement exit. A joint that has been commanded toward the

// Hard iteration budget for an entire move-to-ready. The stuck detector above resets whenever a
// joint twitches past the motion floor, so a joint oscillating against an external load (e.g.
// gravity sag fighting the position hold) can reset both the stuck counter and the arrival
// confirmation window indefinitely -- the ready move then runs at full control-loop rate for
// minutes (observed as the left-YAM startup retry storm, issue #5). The budget is derived from
// the actual travel distance at init (so it is NOT a fixed timeout: long moves get long budgets)
// and only fires when the move is far beyond the velocity-bounded travel time, at which point the
// device completes best-effort and names the joints that never settled.
